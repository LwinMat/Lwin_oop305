The keyword constexpr(constant expression) lets a value constant that it can be tested in compile time. In other words it helps 
a program run faster and use less memory. 

Internal linkage are related to things only in a scope of a translation unit (an implementation file).
While External linkage are things or entities that are declare in a scope within another scope, for this
linkage a thing exists through the whole translationg unit (combination of other object files).

Static variables are variables that are allocated only one time that it is used in the entire program. When declaring a counter
variable to display the extracted data from a file, it was able to have a value that can be executed one time when ever I call
this function.

In part 2, the only changes I did was in the void Cars::read(std::istream& is). What I did was declare and define local variables
that I could use to extract data from a file and put them in the data members of Cars class.


In Workshop 1 part 2 the rule of 3 is necessary because it ensures better code. It also makes an object assigned to another 
object in a secure way. When an object wants an extraction, the rule of three is applied to make copies to another object.


The only challenge I had was to declare and define global variables for the entire program to execute using the 'extern' keyword.
The solution was to declare the global variables using 'extern' only in the header files, then I initilized them by typing 
like declaring basic variable (double 'variable_name' = 0)
